Repository of studies on benefits of standards - ISOInternational Organization for StandardizationInternational Standards for Business, Government and SocietySkip to ContentStudies on benefits of standardsThis webpage contains information on studies on the economic and social benefits of standards for trade, national economies, industry sectors, individual companies and citizens. It is intended as a reference repository of studies that address economic and other benefits of standards, their impacts and their relevance for international trade, innovation and economic development. The studies have been undertaken by different authors, such as national and international standards bodies, research institutes, universities and other international agencies.An effort has been made to include in this repository studies based, as far as possible, on recent and original field research. However, the repository remains a working tool: it does not attempt or claim to be exhaustive, nor does it set any form of hierarchy among existing studies.ISO members, researchers and anybody interested in this matter are invited to provide input and feed-back, thus contributing to improving the quality and extent of the inventory.The list of publications and resources identified are organized in three sections:Main studiesCase studiesOther studies & resourcesMain studiesThis section contains information on major studies on the economic and social benefits of standards for national economies as well as basic research on the functioning of standards and on how standards impact trade, the economy and innovation.Title / AbstractYearImplementation and Certification of ISO/IEC 29110 in an IT Startup in Peru This article presents the implementation of ISO/IEC 29110 in a four-person IT startup company in Peru.
