Founded in 1906, and affiliated to the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Shuguang is a clinical teaching TCM hospital and a clinical collaboration center for traditional medicine of the World Health Organization. The hospital implements an ISO 9001- based quality management system (QMS) to coordinate the standards, regulations and governmental directives it implements in its operations.
