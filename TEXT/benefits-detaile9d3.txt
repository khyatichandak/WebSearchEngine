Apparently, most of the Oil & Gas firms and their suppliers, both in the producing regions and elsewhere in Canada, have developed reasonably effective ways of dealing with the regulatory discrepancies that currently exist, such that they consider them to be more of irritants than obstacles to trade.The study also identifies three main areas for which the development of standards could bring significant value:shipment platform standards for prefabricated modules, which would help to circumvent many of the highway codes and permit restrictions arising from actual road limitations,correspondence tables between Federal, Provincial and Territorial regulations for specific products and services would be a valuable tool for companies that need to negotiate the regulatory conformance system across Canadaservice standards for technical and inspection activities of importance to the Oil & Gas industry would facilitate and support programs aiming at promoting increased mobility of skilled workers.Download(s):URLAdditional information:Classification:EnergyAuthorsThe Centre for Innovative Studies (THECIS)Other bibliographical information:The Centre for Innovative Studies (THECIS), Canada
