Studies on benefits of standards - ISOInternational Organization for StandardizationInternational Standards for Business, Government and SocietySkip to ContentCapacity-Building to Meet International Standards as Public GoodsAs the world becomes increasingly globalized, the role of national borders is changing and the governance of markets can no longer be seen as a local matter. This paper looks at one aspect of market governance, the provision of standards and the capacity to deal with standards for the global market, with particular reference to sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, which deal with food safety, animal health and plant protection. Standards are part of the architecture within which markets operate. On the face of it, they are quintessentially "public goods." According to economic theory, they may be under-supplied, especially if the costs of provision are borne in one market and some of the benefits fall elsewhere. This paper seeks to analyze the role played by standards and standards-related activities both in the world economy and in the process of economic development.Download(s):URLAdditional information:Published:2006Classification:Publications with Development FocusAuthorsLara Newson (University of Sussex, UK), Leonardo Iacovone (University of Sussex, UK), Peter Holmes (University of Sussex, UK), Rungroge Kamondetdacha (University of Sussex, UK)Other bibliographical information:UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)
