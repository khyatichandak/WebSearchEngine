Studies on benefits of standards - ISOInternational Organization for StandardizationInternational Standards for Business, Government and SocietySkip to ContentMAGA Engineering (Pvt) Ltd., Sri LankaThe company selected by the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI), Maga Engineering (Pvt), is a leading constructor employing over 180 engineers, including chartered engineers with wide experience in the technical and managerial aspects of the industry, both locally and overseas:The scope of the study is limited to the building construction sector, thereby excluding operations like bridge and road construction. Owing to the complexity of building projects that cannot be evaluated using an annual framework, the study has been conducted on a single sample building project, representative, to a certain degree, of similar projects within the building construction industry. Focus is placed on the business functions: Procurement, Inbound logistics and Production (construction project management). Maga uses standards for raw materials and quality, environmental and health and safety management system standards.Since the construction industry (including Maga) has been using standards since the very early stages, finding comparative data for most of the construction processes has been difficult, meaning that impacts of standards could only be quantified for three raw materials. Use of management system standards has resulted in more efficient processes for purchasing, store management and billing and a switch to alternative energy sources. The annual contribution to the company EBIT is estimated at 0.54%. of total annual revenue.Download(s):URLAdditional information:Published:2012Other bibliographical information:International Organization for Standardization - ISO
