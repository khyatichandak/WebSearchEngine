Studies on benefits of standards - ISOInternational Organization for StandardizationInternational Standards for Business, Government and SocietySkip to ContentDalian Shipbuilding Industry Co. Ltd., ChinaThe Standardization Administration of the People's Republic of China (SAC) chose to conduct this study on the Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Co. Ltd. (referred to as DSCI), a holding subsidiary of the China Shipbuilding Industry Limited Liability Company.The main features characterizing the shipbuilding industry are the high number of product types and their rapid development, the single unit and small scale production volumes, the long manufacturing periods, the sophisticated technical requirements and highly complex structures. DSCI is a modern final assembly company combining five major industries – shipbuilding, defence, ocean engineering, ship repair (including shipbreaking) and heavy industry. The number of employees is over 7500 in addition to more than 20 000 in supplier companies. The company is not only under obligation to comply with mandatory standards and technical regulations, but also with international rules and specifications. Owing to the many different technologies used by the industry and the complexity of its processes, DSCI uses over 100 000 Chinese and foreign standards, which can be divided into three types: product, process, health, safety and environmental standards.The R&D business function for shipbuilding products is the scope of the assessment with a focus on DSIC’s Design Institute, a core unit of the company using standards in eleven work areas or organizational units ranging from the Development office to the Welding office. By improving development and design efficiency in R&D and reducing design errors, standards are estimated to generate cost savings for the R&D function amounting to 12.19% of its average annual revenue. Standards help to raise the technology level in R&D and expedite the development of new products.Download(s):URLAdditional information:Published:2012Other bibliographical information:International Organization for Standardization - ISO
