Studies on benefits of standards - ISOInternational Organization for StandardizationInternational Standards for Business, Government and SocietySkip to ContentSiemens AG, GermanyChosen by the DIN German Institute for Standardization, this study has been carried out in collaboration with the switch technology and standardization divisions at Siemens AG. Switch technology involves essential components for the transport and distribution of electrical energy for uses ranging from high-voltage circuit breakers in transformer stations to low-voltage switchgear in a building.Owing to the fact that the switch technology is a mature one based on standards existing since decades, the impact of revisions to the DIN-EN 62271 standards series, essential for the switch technology, is considered in this study to see whether such revisions bring added-value to Siemens. Bearing in mind that changes over past years mainly related to optimizing functions and improving the efficiency of the switches, and the observation that Siemens has managed to retain its market position by maintaining a high technical standard as opposed to competing on price, the analysis focuses on the development and market preparation of the switch products.Siemens attaches great value to participation in standardization committees and see it as an important tool for ensuring competitive, future-oriented products. It enables them to already prepare their products for changes currently planned so that no unexpected tasks or costs arise once the standards are finally updated. In some case, it is even possible to profit from the standard's revision. The cumulative benefit from all impacts has been estimated in a range between 1.1% and 2.8% of the company EBIT.Download(s):URLAdditional information:Published:2011Other bibliographical information:International Organization for Standardization - ISO
