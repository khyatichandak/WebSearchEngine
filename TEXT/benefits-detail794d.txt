Studies on benefits of standards - ISOInternational Organization for StandardizationInternational Standards for Business, Government and SocietySkip to ContentBest Practice in Company StandardizationThis article describes a best practice model for standardization within companies based on a process approach to the development of company standards. Per process a best practice is developed based on an investigation within six multinational companies and a review of literature, if any. The findings are benchmarked against experiences in three comparable fields: IT management, quality management and knowledge management. Though the number of company standards exceeds the number of external standards by far, they have been neglected in standardization research. The authors hope that standards practitioners will benefit from their study and that it will stimulate researchers to pay more attention to this topicDownload(s):URLAdditional information:Published:2006Classification:Company StandardizationAuthorsFlorens J.C.
