Repository of studies on benefits of standards - ISOInternational Organization for StandardizationInternational Standards for Business, Government and SocietySkip to ContentStudies on benefits of standardsThis webpage contains information on studies on the economic and social benefits of standards for trade, national economies, industry sectors, individual companies and citizens. It is intended as a reference repository of studies that address economic and other benefits of standards, their impacts and their relevance for international trade, innovation and economic development. The studies have been undertaken by different authors, such as national and international standards bodies, research institutes, universities and other international agencies.An effort has been made to include in this repository studies based, as far as possible, on recent and original field research. However, the repository remains a working tool: it does not attempt or claim to be exhaustive, nor does it set any form of hierarchy among existing studies.ISO members, researchers and anybody interested in this matter are invited to provide input and feed-back, thus contributing to improving the quality and extent of the inventory.The list of publications and resources identified are organized in three sections:Main studiesCase studiesOther studies & resourcesCase studiesThis section contains information on case studies with a focus on the microeconomic impacts of standards as seen from individual companies in various countries. Many case studies apply the ISO Methodology for the assessment of economic benefits of standards, which aims at an identification and quantification of the benefits companies can derive from the use of standards. Other studies demonstrate benefits companies can gain from the participation in standards development or show impacts standards have in certain industry sectors and growth of markets.
