The main purpose being to contribute to the smooth flow of materials across the supply chain thus facilitating distributors. The recommended dimension is 1200mm by 1000mm 4 ways. Research revealed that pallet standardization would not only be advantageous to retailers across Asia but would also bring local retailers in line with International standards. Standardization reduces the delivery and transfer costs by enabling the sharing and exchange of pallets. Racking systems can then be standardized in warehouses and distribution facilities and handling equipment, therefore contributing to the smooth flow of materials across the supply chain.Download(s):Additional information:Classification:Transport & LogisticsOther bibliographical information:GS1 Hong Kong Recommendation to industry.
