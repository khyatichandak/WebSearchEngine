Studies on benefits of standards - ISOInternational Organization for StandardizationInternational Standards for Business, Government and SocietySkip to ContentHow Nations Choose Product Standards and Standards Change NationsThe author, Samuel Krislov, thoroughly explores the origins, evolutions, and influence of product standards -- their systematic choice at the national and international level, and their uses for national definitions and boundaries. Krislov compares and contrasts the United States, the EC, the former Soviet Eastern Bloc, and Japan, to link standard choice with political styles and to trace growing internationalization based on product efficiency criteria. While standards are of mounting concern to politicians, industries, and consumers, especially since the NAFTA and EC agreements, there has been little or no rigorous study of them. Thorough and engaging, this book explains a crucial and poorly understood facet of modern life."Krislov provides a fascinating overview of an extremely important but too often neglected subject, namely business standards and the critical role they have played and continue to play in both the national and global economy.Download(s):URLAdditional information:Published:1997Classification:Publications with Development FocusAuthorsSamuel KrislovISSN/ISBN:082293969-XOther bibliographical information:University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA
