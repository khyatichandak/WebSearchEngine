The results show that primarily Germany's innovative capacity can explain its export performance in France and not its strength in standards. Second, the stocks of international standards in Germany support French exports to Germany. Finally, the results of the intra-industry trade models underscore the common view of the trade fostering effect of international standards.Download(s):URLAdditional information:Published:2005Classification:Publications with Country / Regional FocusAuthorsAndre Jungmittag, Knut BlindISSN/ISBN:0013-0494Other bibliographical information:In Économie Appliquée, 58 (2), 2005, S. 99-125.
