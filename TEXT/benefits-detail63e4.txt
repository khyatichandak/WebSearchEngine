Studies on benefits of standards - ISOInternational Organization for StandardizationInternational Standards for Business, Government and SocietySkip to ContentShenzhen Meteorological Service Center, ChinaThis is a study to determine the non-economic benefits of standards on the Shenzhen Meteorological Service Center (SMSC). In providing public meteorological information services, industrial meteorological safeguards and technical services for lightning protection, SMSC uses Chinese and internal company standards. The use of standardized graphical symbols for weather and for disaster warning, has resulted in a common understanding of meteorological information among the public. Generating and disseminating information for the various channels (hotline, television, etc.) according to internal company standards improves quality, accuracy and efficiency, increasing the volume of information and broadening its use. More accurate and timely weather forecasts increase the reliability of services for disaster prevention and mitigation and a wide use of technical specifications for the inspection of lightning protection devices in buildings leads to more reliable lightning protection devices and less lightning induced accidents.Download(s):URLAdditional information:Published:2014ISSN/ISBN:978-92-67-10625-0Other bibliographical information:International Organization for Standardization - ISO
