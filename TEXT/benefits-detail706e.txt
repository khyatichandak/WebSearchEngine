Against this background, a survey among European service companies addressed the question of in which service-related categories formal and informal standards are implemented. In total 364 European service companies responded to the on-line survey. Relying on the assessment of the importance of the various service-related standardization aspects, it was possible to identify a taxonomy of service standards containing five clusters of service standards 'Service Management', 'Service Employee', 'Service Delivery', 'Customer Interaction', and 'Data Flows and Security', which correspond very closely to the ex ante applied typology derived from the literature.Download(s):URLAdditional information:Published:2006Classification:ServicesAuthorsKnut BlindOther bibliographical information:In the Service Industries Journal Volume 26 Number 4, June 2006, S. 397-420.
