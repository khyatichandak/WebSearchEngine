Studies on benefits of standards - ISOInternational Organization for StandardizationInternational Standards for Business, Government and SocietySkip to ContentWho Develops ISO Standards? A Survey of Participation in ISO's International Standards Development ProcessesThis study analyzes representation in ISO's standards development activities from two perspectives: geographic region and stakeholder group. The first part of the study looks at the country/regional representation in all active technical committees (TCs) within ISO. The second part looks at ISO/TC 207 â€“ Environmental Management, the second largest committee in ISO, as a case study to examine both regional and stakeholder representation in more detail. TC 207 was selected because it is emblematic of ISOâ€™s transformation from a technical standard-setting institution to one that is increasingly affecting broader public policy issues. The study concludes with a brief review of two new initiatives within ISO to develop water management standards and a corporate social responsibility guidance standard (shortened to â€œSRâ€? within ISO circles), both of which signify ISOâ€™s continued expansion into the social and environmental arenas.Download(s):URL (Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment, and Security)Additional information:Published:2004Classification:Publications with Development FocusAuthorsJason Morrison, Mari MorikawaOther bibliographical information:Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment, and Security, Oakland, California, USA
