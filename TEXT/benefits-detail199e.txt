Studies on benefits of standards - ISOInternational Organization for StandardizationInternational Standards for Business, Government and SocietySkip to ContentTrade and the Impact of Innovations and Standards: The Case of Germany and the UKThe effects of patents as indicators for innovations and standards on German trade performance are analysed in general and Germanâ€“British trade in detail. The latter analysis goes a step further than the approach of Swann et al. (1996) and is based on a broader and more detailed database. The results show that Germany's export performance can primarily be explained by its innovative capacity and only to a small extent by its strength in standards. Furthermore, the results underscore the common view of the trade-fostering effect of international standards, while "idiosyncratic" standards have ambiguous effects on exports.Download(s):URLAdditional information:Published:2005Classification:Publications with Country / Regional FocusAuthorsAndre Jungmittag (University of Wuppertal, Germany), Knut Blind (Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, Karlsruhe, Germany)Other bibliographical information:In Applied Economics 37, 2005, S. 1385-1398.
