Studies on benefits of standards - ISOInternational Organization for StandardizationInternational Standards for Business, Government and SocietySkip to ContentCombining Economic and Social Goals in the Design of Production Systems by Using Ergonomics StandardsIn the designing of production systems, economic and social goals can be combined, if ergonomics is integrated into the design process. More than 50 years of ergonomics research and practice have resulted in a large number of ergonomics standards for designing physical and organizational work environments. This paper gives an overview of the 174 international ergonomics standards from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and European ergonomics standards from the Comit√© Europ√©en de Normalisation (CEN) standards in this field, and discusses their applicability in design processes.The available standards include general recommendations for integrating ergonomics into the design process, as well as specific requirements for manual handling, mental load, task design, human‚Ä?computer-interaction, noise, heat, body measurements, and other topics.The standards can be used in different phases of the design process: allocation of system functions between humans and machines, design of the work organization, work tasks and jobs, design of work environment, design of work equipment, hardware and software, and design of workspace and workstation.The paper is meant to inform engineers and managers involved in the design of production systems about the existence of a large number of ISO and CEN standards on ergonomics, which can be used to optimize human well-being and overall system performance.Download(s):URLAdditional information:Published:2004Classification:ErgonomicsAuthorsA.
