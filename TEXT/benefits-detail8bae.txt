Studies on benefits of standards - ISOInternational Organization for StandardizationInternational Standards for Business, Government and SocietySkip to ContentOn the Effects of IS Company Standards on Business Process PerformanceIn this study a research model is designed that describes the effects on business performance of IS company standards facilitating processes. This model is based on a pilot case study and the small number of literature available on company standards. Subsequently, the descriptive model is used in two in-depth case studies at a large financial services corporation. The first one concerns the effects of introducing an IS product standard in a business unit and the other considers the usage of process standards in a software development department. Effects of these standards are identified, also in relation to flexibility. To conclude, implications for future research are presented.Download(s):URLAdditional information:Published:2005Classification:Company StandardizationAuthorsHenk De Vries (Erasmus University, Netherlands), Pieter Ribbers (Tilburg University, Netherlands), Robert van Wessel (Tilburg University, Netherlands)Other bibliographical information:In Tineke M.
