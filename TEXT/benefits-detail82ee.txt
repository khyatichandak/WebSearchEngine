Studies on benefits of standards - ISOInternational Organization for StandardizationInternational Standards for Business, Government and SocietySkip to ContentStandardization and Business Development: The Global Impact of the IOSA Standards and the Value of AnticipationThe IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) programme consists of standards against which the operational, management and control systems of an airline are assessed. Developed between 2001 and 2003 as a result of collaboration between disparate aviation industry stakeholders, IOSA is having a global impact on airline safety standards. In developing the IOSA standards and an audit programme for assessing conformity with those standards, the industry stakeholders responsible for IOSA anticipated change and regulatory action. This case study of IOSA examines the impetus for the programme and its standards development process. It then analyses the economic, business and social impact of the development and use of the IOSA standards, with a focus on the linkages between standardization and business development. The paper concludes with some of the implications and applications of the IOSA standards, programme and process.Download(s):URLAdditional information:Published:2006Classification:Transport & LogisticsAuthorsDavid Hodgkinson (University of Western Australia)ISSN/ISBN:2-8318-8867-0
